In this paper, together with Panu Poutvaara and Cevat Giray Aksoy, we show that the huge roll-out of mobile internet access increased intentions to emigrate on a worldwide basis. We find that it is driven by people without prior connections abroad and that preferred destinations change towards destination countries that were previously less popular among people from the same country. This has interesting implications for future migration patterns!
