I recently published my first paper. Together with Till Nikolka, Panu Poutvaara and Uwe Sunde we discuss the stability of risk preferences among students in 4 countries. We find that incentivized risk preferences increased during the pandemic, particularly for young men. This is in line with the large increase of small investment platforms during the Pandemic such as Robinhood. However, the opposite happened for stated risk preferences: people, predominantly women, became more risk averse during the pandemic, which may be explained by a changing interpretation of risk preference during a health crisis. This shows that it the way of eliciting such a key parameter is highly context-dependent.  The paper has been published in [Economics Letters](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176521004377) (open access) !
