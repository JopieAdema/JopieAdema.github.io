We have a new working paper out! Together with Kai Gehring and Panu Poutvaara we study narratives about immigrants in Germany since 2005 using a combination of custom-build dictionaries and NLP tools to accurately capture how the themes and sentiments of narratives across Germany and across time have evolved between 2005 and 2019. We developed our method to accurately capture how newspapers portray immigrants throughout articles; therefore our approach is based on the sentence level where we make sure to only capture statements directly related to the focal immigrant or immigrant group + uncover narratives. Germany is an interesting country because of its large recent refugee inflows as well as a very regionalized newspaper market.  Among others, we find (perhaps surprisingly) that newspapers in former Easter Germany write less, contain more economic narratives and more positively about immigrants than other newspapers. Furthermore, we show that the local presence of immigrants shape the narratives in regional newspapers.
