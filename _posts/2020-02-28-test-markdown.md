I recently published my first paper. Together with Till Nikolka, Panu Poutvaara and Uwe Sunde we discuss the stability of risk preferences among students in 5 countries. We find that incentivized risk preferences increased during the pandemic, particularly for young men. The paper had been published in [Economics Letters]([https://duckduckgo.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176521004377))
