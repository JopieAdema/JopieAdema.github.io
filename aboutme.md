My name is Joop Adema. I am a PhD student at the MGSE program and working at the ifo Institute in Munich. I research the economics of migration, media and how it matters for prospective migrants and attitudes towards migrants, labor markets and technological change.

- Economics of Migration:
How do new technologies change migration decisions? And how are migration intentions shaped?

- Media Economics:
How does the media affect migration decisions? And how does the media portray migrants and how does this affect the paths of integration?

- Technological change: 
How does robotization affect labor markets? Why is there a strong backlash against robotization and immigration in some places, but not in others?
