**Replication**
<p></p>
Whenever I encounter important published studies that have crucial flaws, I try to bring this to the attention.
  - Cold Showers and work absence  (with Adriaan ter Braak)  [*Blogpost by Sjamadriaan (Dutch)*](https://www.sjamadriaan.nl/p/f76b9e72-e23a-4169-9dbd-3f841ebd1872) 
    -  <font size="2">  A study published in PLOS ONE finding that cold showers strongly decreases work absence has implausible descriptive statistics, uses an incorrect statistical model and has undeclared conflicts of interest.
  - Criminalization of purchasing sex and rape in Sweden  (with Olle Folke and Johanna Rickne) [*Franfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (German)*](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/sexarbeit-fuehrt-ein-verbot-von-prostitution-zu-mehr-vergewaltigungen-19619721.html)  [*Twitter thread*](https://twitter.com/johannarickne/status/1773002832632836549) [*Replication files*](https://jopieadema.github.io/assets/img/replication.zip) 
     -  <font size="2"> A study published in JPOPE finding large effects of criminalization of prostitution on rape estimates an impossible RDD specification, which effectively identifies a seasonal effect rather than a discontinuity.

**Participation in replication projects**
<p></p>
I also participate in several replication projects, which aim to contribute to a more replicable and thus better social science:
  - [*ManyEconomists*](https://nickch-k.github.io/ManyEconomists/)
  - [*R2E*]([https://nickch-k.github.io/ManyEconomists/](https://www.rwi-essen.de/en/research-advice/departments/climate-change-and-development/research-group/research-projects/project/robustness-and-replicability-in-economics-r2e-277))
  - [*ERROR*](https://error.reviews/)
